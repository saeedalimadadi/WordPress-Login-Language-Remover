# WordPress Login Language Remover

This is a straightforward code snippet for WordPress that hides the language switcher dropdown on the login screen. By default, WordPress provides an option for users to change the language directly from the login page. If your site operates in a single language or you prefer to manage language settings centrally, removing this dropdown can simplify the login experience and potentially enhance security by reducing unnecessary options.

## Why hide the language dropdown?

* **Streamlined Login:** Simplifies the login interface by removing an unneeded option, leading to a cleaner user experience.
* **Single Language Focus:** Ideal for websites that operate exclusively in one language, preventing accidental language changes by users.
* **Reduced Clutter:** Clears up the login screen, making it less overwhelming for users.

## Installation

There are two primary ways to implement this code:

### Method 1: As a Standalone Plugin (Recommended)

Creating a small, custom plugin is the best way to add this type of code. It ensures your modification remains active even if you change your theme.

1.  Create a new folder named `wp-login-language-hide` in your WordPress site's `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Inside this new folder, create a file named `wp-login-language-hide.php`.
3.  Copy and paste the following code into `wp-login-language-hide.php`:

    ```php
    <?php
    /**
     * Plugin Name: WordPress Login Language Hide
     * Description: Removes the language switcher dropdown from the WordPress login screen.
     * Version: 1.0
     * Author: Your Name (Optional)
     */

    add_filter( 'login_display_language_dropdown', '__return_false' );
    ?>
    ```

4.  Go to your WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to **"Plugins"**, and **activate** the "WordPress Login Language Hide" plugin.

### Method 2: Adding to your Theme's functions.php File

If you prefer not to create a new plugin, you can add the code directly to your active theme's `functions.php` file. **It's highly recommended to back up your `functions.php` file before making any changes.**

1.  Navigate to `wp-content/themes/YourThemeName/` (replace `YourThemeName` with the actual name of your active theme).
2.  Open the `functions.php` file.
3.  Add the following code to the end of the file (before the closing `?>` tag, if one exists):

    ```php
    add_filter( 'login_display_language_dropdown', '__return_false' );
    ```
